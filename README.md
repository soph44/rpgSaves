# About

This application is WIP. The intent is to practice creating and testing a basic REST API using Java, Swagger, and Postman.
This application will provide DnD players a management system for their characters and properties.
Data will persist on a database such as PostgresSQL or will interface with AWS/GCP datawarehouse.
